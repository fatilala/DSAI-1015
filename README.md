## SC1015 Mini-Project - Song Popularity Prediction
### ABOUT
Our project aims to predict whether a song will be popular amongst the general public based on the song’s features, like loudness, energy, etc.
We utilised data science concepts by importing a spotify dataset and training a model in order to predict a certain trend or outcome and derive information that can help us in making an informed decision. 

### Practical Motivation and Problem Definition
We are simulating playing the role of a record label/music producer who is interested in looking at the performance of artists and how well their songs might perform based on the song’s elements.
While popularity of a song or the capability of a song to rank high on charts may be influenced by the current trends, the various components that make up a song may be the answer for producing a hit song. Therefore, one can then predict how well a newly released song can perform based on these patterns. Therefore, these producers would want to predict how well a song will perform based on different metrics and song characteristics to appeal to a larger audience. 

Hence, our problem definition: 
◦  Discovering if it’s possible to predict popularity of a song using its features, and in the process, examining other secondary features as well such as which genre is the best     
   performing genre in terms of popularity.
