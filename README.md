#SC1015 Mini-Project - Song Popularity Prediction
## ABOUT
Our project aims to predict whether a song will be popular amongst the general public based on the songâ€™s features, like loudness, energy, etc.
We utilised data science concepts by importing a spotify dataset and training a model in order to predict a certain trend or outcome and derive information that can help us in making an informed decision.
